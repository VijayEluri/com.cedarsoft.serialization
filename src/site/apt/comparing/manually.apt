Comparing to manually written code

  Writing your serialization code manually is always an option. This offers the best flexibility.

  But very often this results in suboptimal design due to missing time and experience. Why
  reinventing the wheel and repeating many failures?

  Due to the lack of time, often even very basic things are omitted (like the version information).
  Later somebody has to work around those shortfalls. According to experience this will take a lot of time...
