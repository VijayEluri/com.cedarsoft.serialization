Custom Backend

  cedarsoft Serialization offers the possibility to implement a own backend on your own. This is <<not>> necessary for the
  serialization of your own business objects using XML.
  But if your serializer shall not use XML but instead some other format (e.g. binary) it is necessary to implement your
  own backend.

  Just implement your own backend class that extends {{{./xref/com/cedarsoft/serialization/AbstractSerializer.html}<com.cedarsoft.serialization.AbstractSerializer>}}.
